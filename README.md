# Stellar-Classification-Project
Project for Advanced Machine Learning course of MSc in Data science for management
The goal of this project is to apply supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning to predict the object class, that in this case can be star, galaxy or quasar. I decided to use jupyter also for some technical stuff that can be easilly added on it.
